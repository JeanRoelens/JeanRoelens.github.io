So here you are, wondering why you're here, how you ended there, what is this page, or even how dolphin sleep.

If you ask yourself those question you're in the good place, i'll try to keep it short about this page.

_Why i'm here ?_
{: .fs-5 }
There's multiple possible answer for this, one and the most common you've lost yourself on the internet and you've clicked yet another random link.
The second possibilities is you're one of the few people who knew me personally and wanted to see my github page. Or and for third, you're a member of my school and need to rate my professional experience ( i hope you'll like it ).

_What is this page ?_ 
{: .fs-5 }
I'll be honest with you, at first it was supposed to be just another IT student page about my professional experience to just have another grade done by my school, but as i was doing this page i was like "hey people don't have to be bored while going through this page, and maybe even i can teach or even share some of my experience, feeling, or even insight on what i like." so here it is, a webpage which will not be updated regularly because if i make a new article i want it to be interesting for me but mostly for you.

_Who are you ?_
{: .fs-5 }
I'm an IT Student named Jean R at Ynov Toulouse Campus, my age doesn't matter, and i like a bunch of things like IT ( crazy innit ?), Sci-Fi, Phylosophy, STEM, RPG games, music, nordic culture etc... If you want a more conventionnal resume -> [here]({% link docs/resume.md %})

_How dolphin sleep ?_
{: .fs-5 }
Since dolphin need to be in water to keep hydrated, and have oxygen to breath they found a peculiar way of sleeping, they will use one half of their brain for managing is whole body while the other half rest, and they will change the half when needed. To do so they'll use a third smaller "brain" which manage all this.
